FADE IN: EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT Darkness. A single lightbulb illuminates an alleyway. A shapes lies prone on the ground. Suddenly, the sound of footsteps. A lone figure appears in the alley, tentative at first. Then, with purpose, the figure steps forward into the light. It's a man, late 40s, disheveled and worn. He's a detective. He kneels down beside the body. It's a woman, young, pretty. She's been badly beaten. The detective looks around, takes in the scene. Then he stands, takes out his cell phone, and dials a number. DETECTIVE Yeah, I got a body here. Send a bus. He pockets his phone and looks down at the dead woman again. Something about her pulls at him. He can't quite explain it, but he knows he has to find out who did this. DETECTIVE (CONT'D) Sorry, darlin'. I'll find the bastards who did this to you.
